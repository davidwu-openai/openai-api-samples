Sample usage for OpenAI APIs

## Responses API examples
The `responses_api_examples.py` script shows how to:

- send a basic prompt using the `responses` endpoint
- retrieve a response by ID to demonstrate stateful behavior
- continue a conversation by referencing `previous_response_id`
- call the built-in `web_search` tool

Run the script after setting `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment.
